/**
 * Tree node used by ActionTree to represent a navigable node in the tree.
 * <p>
 * <p>It's usually sufficient to build a tree from nodes and not have separate classes. However, the very specific
 * functionality used by the ActionTree makes it easier if the classes are separated, as the insertion and retrieval
 * logic is fairly complex. This keeps the classes smaller and easier to handle.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Every node can have children, but also actions. Considered theoretically, this results in a multidimensional tree,
 * as nodes allow N number of children, and also N actions. To simplify this, methods and children are separate entities
 * even though this would make drawing and imagining the tree more complicated.</p>
