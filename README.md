# Jazz Plugin Base Service
Abstract base service implementation which serves as the base class for web services as plugins.

## Abstract:
This is an abstract implementation of a jazz plugin which can be used to implement (restful) http web services that can be deployed as an update-site. For details on how an actual service extending this base package looks like, see the [Jazz Plugin Maven Archetype](https://github.com/jazz-community/jazz-plugin-maven-archetype). That page also demonstrates how an actual implementation can be integrated into your sytem.

This page concentrates on the functionalities of the base service and how to use them to build web services.

## Motivation:

Notes:

* Include how to change versions. This should also be included in other readmes, such as for the archetype.
* Link to the extensions work shop
